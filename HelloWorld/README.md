1. Use "HelloWorld.cpp" if you want to compile the exact code that was used.<br>
2. In order to correctly compile the code, create a new project;<br><br>

3. Paste the code at the bottom of the generated source file.<br>
4. Compile the project in order to create the executable on your own.<br>
* The other "HelloWorld" .cpp (Assembly and CMD) files are just other forms of using the messagebox. 
* Only "HelloWorld.cpp" will work with the PH POC.
